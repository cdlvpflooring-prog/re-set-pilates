# re:set pilates — what is not finished end to end

Everything below works on screen as a demo. This is what each flow still needs before real customers use it.

## Launch prep decisions (owner review, 20 Oct 2026)
- **No Arbox.** The booking system is built in-house (site + Cloudflare Worker + Airtable). Arbox was removed from checkout, config, chat answers, receipts and the schema.
- **Payments not live yet** (`flags.paymentsLive: false` in `src/config/site.ts`). Every buy/book button (pricing, booking a class, gift cards) ends in the launch waitlist form instead of a sample purchase. Sign-ups land in Airtable **Launch Waitlist** (name, phone, optional email, class type, Adult morning / Teen evening, what they wanted, which class slot, source, contacted ✓). Name + phone are required.
- [ ] **Choose the payment provider** for Bit + credit card (not chosen yet; e.g. Grow/Meshulam, PayPlus, Cardcom, Tranzila). Then add the links in `siteConfig.payments`, set `paymentsLive: true`, and call everyone on the Launch Waitlist.
- [ ] Airtable: create an automation "New Launch Waitlist row → email Orit" (same as the lead email) and a view sorted by Submitted, filtered on Contacted = off.
- **Introductory month (owner, 21 Oct 2026, limited time):** adults ₪55 a single class / ₪50 per class with any plan; teens ₪50 / ₪45. Shown as a strip on the schedule and on every class row (`intro` in `src/config/pricing.ts`; set `active: false` when it ends). [ ] Airtable *Plans & Prices*: set row `single` to 55 and add row `tsingle` (teen single class, 50).
- **Requests (private, duo, closed groups):** the `/request` page (type tiles, preferred days and times, name, phone, note) replaces the old contact-form link; it arrives as a lead whose message carries the type, days, times and package. The "Private or Duo session" card under the schedule is gone.
- **Team:** only Orit is listed; every class shows "with Orit". Add instructors in `src/config/team.ts` when they join.
- **Hero (21 Oct):** greeting, headline and two buttons only, centred; the facts line, the sub-line and the launch note were removed at the owner's request. The photo/motion stays until a new hero asset exists.
- **Single class: ₪55** (teens ₪50). Shown on every Reformer class page next to time/length/instructor, on the Reformer, Mat and Teens service pages, at the top of the punch-card list, and as "Single class · ₪50" in the booking sheet. Airtable *Plans & Prices* now has rows `single` (₪50) and `teens` (₪180).
- **Schedule (planned):** 50-minute classes on the hour, 10-minute changeover (owner, 21 Oct). Sun–Fri mornings 08:00, 09:00, 10:00, 11:00 = adults (Reformer for now). Sun–Thu evenings 17:00–20:00 = teens (by request until the teen timetable is set). Closed Saturday; no Friday evening. Final timetable is set closer to opening (`src/lib/booking.ts`).
- [ ] **Mat:** no Mat slots until Mat instructors join, so the Mat schedule tab is hidden and Mat shows "By request". When it starts: up to 8 people, set `bookable: true` in `src/config/services.ts` and add slots in `src/lib/booking.ts` (Mat capacity is not modelled yet).
- [ ] **Circuit class (idea):** 5 reformers + 3 mat stations, up to 8 people, each station a different exercise. Not on the site yet; decide name, price and slots before adding it.
- [ ] **For Orit:** create the workout routines and the levels (e.g. beginner / intermediate / advanced) for Reformer, Mat and the circuit. Studio planning only, no site change yet.
- Contact page: parking = street parking; Google profile + review link set (`g.page/r/CYP9NF0IiTdlEBM`). WhatsApp and phone rows are **hidden** until the new number exists (fill `contact.whatsapp` and `contact.phone`; the WhatsApp card, chat button and receipts pick it up automatically).

## Scheduling and booking
- Class times follow the planned week; "spots left" is still sample data. Needs live availability from the in-house booking backend.
- Bookings and cancellations are sent to Airtable (Bookings) through the Worker, but availability is not read back yet, so two people can pick the same bed.
- Bed choice is saved with the booking; nothing yet blocks a bed someone else took.
- Membership limits (for example 3 classes a week) and pass balances are not enforced; the numbers on the profile are estimates.
- Waitlist and "remind me" are switches only. Nobody is notified. Needs a messaging service (WhatsApp / SMS / email).
- There is no sign-in. Needs real accounts (phone-code login, see `ACCOUNTS-PLAN.md`).

## Checkout (memberships and passes)
- Hidden while `paymentsLive` is off (waitlist instead). Once on: Bit and card buttons open the provider links in `siteConfig.payments`.
- After real payment, the provider must tell the app the plan is active (payment webhook → Worker → Airtable). Today Orit confirms it by hand in Airtable.
- Name, phone and email typed at checkout are not saved or sent anywhere.
- No receipt or confirmation message is sent.

## Gift cards
- No payment is taken and nothing is sent to the recipient.
- No gift code is created, so a gift cannot be redeemed.
- To make it real: (1) a payment link, (2) a unique code per gift stored somewhere the studio can see (Airtable Gift Cards), (3) delivery to the recipient by WhatsApp or email with the note, (4) a way to redeem the code at checkout or at the desk, (5) an expiry rule.
- "Notify me" for the shop saves nothing.

## Contact and leads
- Main contact is resetpilates11@gmail.com (set in `src/config/site.ts`).
- The "call me back" form sends straight into Airtable (Leads & Inquiries) through the Cloudflare Worker once `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` is set on the Worker. Until then, or if sending fails, it opens a ready-to-send email to that Gmail as before. Steps: `CLOUDFLARE-PLAN.md` section 1.
- Google Business Profile and review links are set. Still to do: the Place ID (`social.googlePlaceId`) so directions open the listing.
- The three Google reviews on the home page are labelled samples (demo mode only). Replace them with real reviews in `src/config/team.ts`.
- WhatsApp and phone: hidden until the new number exists. Parking: street parking.

## Content placeholders (planned for the next version)
- Studio photos and hero video (after construction and the professional shoot).
- Instructor names, bios and portraits; fuller founder bio and background story.
- Reviews and press (hidden until real ones exist).

## Before going live
- Live at https://resetpilates.org (Cloudflare, auto-published from `main`). Open items: `CLOUDFLARE-PLAN.md` section 1.
- Turn off demo mode (`flags.demoMode`) and confirm launch pricing on/off.
- New offers (Oct 2026 flyers): add a "Teens" plan in Airtable *Plans & Prices* with Website ID `teens`, regular price 180, monthly, validity 1 month, or the teens checkout returns "unknown plan". Reformer and Mat share one price list; the chosen class is written into the membership name, e.g. "2× per week (Mat)". Group packages (private group 350, event 750) are request-only and arrive as leads with interest "Event" and the package in the message. (The `teens` row now exists in Airtable.)
- Photos for Teens and Closed groups are stand-ins (`ex-rest`, `studio`) until the shoot.
- Google Analytics ID (or Cloudflare Web Analytics). Sitemap and `robots.txt` are set for `resetpilates.org`.
- Check on a real iPhone and Android phone, in Hebrew and English.

## My progress (AI trainer MVP, spec in `AI-TRAINER-SPEC.md`)
- Works as a demo only: answers, check-ins and progress live in the visitor's own browser. Needs sign-in and a private server database (health data encrypted, seen only by the member and her instructor) before real use.
- Attendance comes from sample data plus the visitor's own demo bookings. Needs attendance from the in-house bookings.
- Safety reviews (pain 7+, rising pain, high soreness, onboarding red flags) show in a demo "Studio view" inside Details. Needs a real staff screen and a notification to Orit (WhatsApp / email) that retries until she acknowledges.
- Orit must approve: health-consent wording, the "stop and see a doctor" wording, all thresholds and score targets in `src/config/trainer.ts`, whether clients may self-test at home, and who covers safety reviews when she is away.
- Included resources are sample titles with no content. Supply real videos/guides and set `approved: true`.
- Personal paid suggestions are switched off (`paidCards.enabled: false`) until catalog and membership data are connected; members who opt in see a plain link to the price list.
- Not built yet (phase 2 in the spec): spring/level progression graph, re-assessment radar chart, trainer level-ups, AI-written recaps and load suggestions, nutrition.

## Receipts (invoice + receipt after every purchase)

Built: every membership, pass and gift card purchase makes a receipt (number `RS-YYMMDD-XXXX`) with the logo and studio contact details. It is saved in the app (Profile → Purchases & receipts, plus a notification card), has a private printable link (`/r/…`, encrypted), and is sent automatically on whichever channels are set up below. Unused classes move to the new plan, and the same running monthly membership can't be bought twice.

To switch on each channel (any channel left unset is simply skipped):
- [ ] **Business details on the receipt**: fill `business.legalName` and `business.taxId` (עוסק number) in `src/config/site.ts`. Receipts show only the email; the WhatsApp number appears once `contact.whatsapp` is filled (no social handles or address).
- [ ] **Email**: in Cloudflare → Email → Email Sending, onboard `resetpilates.org` (adds DNS records), then uncomment `"send_email"` in `wrangler.jsonc`. Sends from `receipts@resetpilates.org`, replies go to the Gmail, and the Gmail gets a copy of every receipt.
- [ ] **WhatsApp** (new studio number): WhatsApp Business Cloud API. Create and get approved a template (Hebrew + English) with body parameters {{1}} first name, {{2}} receipt number, {{3}} total, {{4}} receipt link. Then add Worker secrets `WHATSAPP_TOKEN`, `WHATSAPP_PHONE_ID` and `WHATSAPP_RECEIPT_TEMPLATE` (the template name).
- [ ] **SMS** (only used when WhatsApp is not set up): Twilio secrets `TWILIO_SID`, `TWILIO_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_FROM`.
- [ ] Optional: a separate `RECEIPT_SECRET` for the receipt links (otherwise the Turnstile secret is used; changing it breaks old links).
- [ ] Legal: this is a purchase confirmation. The official tax invoice/receipt (חשבונית מס / קבלה) must come from the payment or accounting system (Green Invoice or the payment provider) once connected.
