# re:set pilates — Airtable plan

One Airtable base, **re:set pilates — Studio OS**, that records every person, plan, booking and payment the website and app touch, so it can be used for marketing, sales and record-keeping.

Arbox stays the system that actually books classes and charges members. Airtable is the studio's own record: it collects what the website captures (sign-ups, leads, quiz answers, chat questions, gift cards) and keeps a copy of what Arbox knows (members, plans, bookings, payments), so the studio can see one complete picture of each customer.

Legend for field types: **Text** (single line), **Long text**, **Email**, **Phone**, **Date**, **Date & time**, **Number**, **Currency (₪)**, **Checkbox**, **Single select**, **Multi select**, **Link** (to another tab), **Lookup / Rollup / Count** (calculated from a linked tab), **Formula**, **Attachment**, **Created time**, **Last modified**.

9. **Waitlist spot opens → notify the first person in line.**

## How the website will send data to Airtable

The Airtable token must never be put inside the website code: anyone can read a website's code in their browser and would get full access to the base. The safe setup is a small private relay (a Cloudflare Worker on the same Cloudflare account as the site) that holds the token as a secret and accepts only these website events:

| Website event | Writes to |
|---|---|
| Lead / call-me-back form | Leads & Inquiries (+ Members, matched by phone) |
| Checkout completed | Members, Memberships, Payments |
| Booking confirmed / cancelled | Bookings |
| Joined waitlist | Waitlist |
| Gift card bought | Gift Cards, Payments |
| Quiz finished | Quiz Answers |
| Chat question not answered | Chat Questions |

Arbox data (members, plans, classes, payments) is copied in on a schedule once the Arbox API access is set up, matched by Arbox ID or phone number.

---

## What's needed to build it

1. **A token that can create the base.** The token shared can't see any bases or workspaces yet. Create a new one at airtable.com/create/tokens with scopes `data.records:read`, `data.records:write`, `schema.bases:read`, `schema.bases:write`, and access to the re:set workspace.
2. **Replace the shared token.** It was pasted into a chat, so regenerate it and delete the old one.
3. Decide who besides Orit gets access, and keep **Health & Consent** to Orit only.

---

## Website ↔ Airtable sync decisions (owner, 9–10 Oct 2026)

**Accounts and sign-in**
- Visitors give first name, last name and phone on their first booking; the app remembers them after that.
- Sign-in options: WhatsApp code (WhatsApp Business account on the studio's new number; Meta charges a small fee per code), Google, and email magic link.
- After buying a plan, the customer is invited to build a full profile (the AI trainer onboarding). They can skip it and finish later.

**Consent**
- Unticked "Send me news and offers" box on the lead form and at checkout → Members: Marketing consent, Consent date, Consent source.
- Required tickbox at checkout: terms + 24-hour cancellation policy → Health & Consent: Terms & cancellation policy accepted, with date.
- Waiver / health declaration: online form, opened from the profile or by scanning a QR code at the studio. Saved in Health & Consent (wording to be approved by a lawyer).

**Health data**
- AI trainer check-ins (pain, energy, soreness, pregnancy) go to a new **Trainer Check-ins** tab that only Orit can see, next to Health & Consent. Never in Members or marketing views.

**Forms**
- Lead form: first name, last name, phone, email (optional), interest, preferred time (morning / midday / evening), "How did you hear about us?", marketing opt-in.
- "How did you hear about us?" is also asked once at checkout. Campaign links (`utm_` tags) are read automatically and saved as Source detail.
- Gift cards: the buyer gives their own name, phone and email and receives the card (image + code) to forward or print. Recipient name and note stay on the card.
- Quiz: the result shows first, then an optional "Leave your number and Orit will send you a plan". Answers are saved whether or not they leave details.
- Ask Orit chat: every question is saved to Chat Questions with topic, language and whether it was answered. Question text is no longer sent to analytics.

**Payments and alerts**
- Purchases are saved as **Pending**. Orit marks them Paid by hand until the Arbox sync does it automatically.
- New lead / booking / purchase / gift card: saved in Airtable, plus an email to resetpilates11@gmail.com and a WhatsApp message to Orit.

**Matching details for the relay**
- Plans & Prices gets a **Website ID** field (m1x, m2x, m3x, m4x, munl, p5, p10, p15) so checkout can link the right plan.
- Bed numbers: the site counts 0–4, Airtable 1–5 (relay adds 1).
- Payment method "card" → "Credit card".
- Chat topics: the site's 26 answer topics are grouped into the 8 Airtable topics.

**Relay setup**
- Claude writes the Cloudflare Worker in the repo; the owner deploys it from the Cloudflare dashboard and pastes a fresh Airtable key as a secret there.

### Applied to the live base (10 Oct 2026)

Checked: all 16 tabs present; the 11 rows in Plans & Prices match `src/config/pricing.ts` (prices, launch prices, bonus sessions, popular badges); quiz, payment, bed and booking-status options cover every value the site produces.

Added:
- Plans & Prices → **Website ID** (filled: m1x, m2x, m3x, m4x, munl, p5, p10, p15, private, duo, gift)
- Members → **Signs in with** (WhatsApp code / Google / Email link), **Trainer profile completed**
- Leads & Inquiries → **How did you hear**, **Marketing consent**
- Health & Consent → **Terms accepted on**, **Signed via** (Profile / Studio QR code / Paper), **Signature (typed name)**
- Chat Questions → **Answer used** (the site's chat answer id)
- Classes → **Website class ID** (e.g. reformer_2026-10-12_1800)
- New tab **Trainer Check-ins** (Orit only): Member, Booking, Date, Energy 1–5, Soreness 0–10, Pain 0–10, Pain locations, Member notes, Safety review, Review reason, Orit's resolution

Relay value mapping: quiz `strength/calm/care/together` → Strength / Calm & mobility / Gentle return / Together; `none/some/regular` → None / Some / Regular; `group/solo/pair` → Small group / One-to-one / With a friend; payment `card` → Credit card; bed index +1; booked via App; purchases → Payments status Pending.
